# LangChain v1.0 – Hands-On Experiments & Learning

This repository contains my hands-on exploration of **LangChain v1.0**, focusing on
understanding its new architecture and building core Generative AI components
through practical experimentation.

The goal of this project is to gain a clear, working understanding of how
LangChain v1.0 can be used to design RAG pipelines, dynamic prompting systems,
agent workflows, and multimodal applications.

## What This Repository Covers

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Dynamic prompt templates
- Runtime model selection and switching
- Custom agent middleware logic
- Chat-based LLM interactions
- Image + text (multimodal) workflows

---

## Why This Project

LangChain v1.0 introduced significant changes compared to earlier versions.
Instead of relying on theory alone, this repository documents my learning by
building and testing each concept hands-on using real code.

This helps solidify:
- How LangChain components interact
- How agents and tools are structured
- How prompts and models can be controlled dynamically

## Tech Stack

- Python
- LangChain v1.0
- OpenAI / OpenRouter compatible LLM APIs
- FAISS / Vector databases (where applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook
